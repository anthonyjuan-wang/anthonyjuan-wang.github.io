# Welcome to My Blog

I'm excited to share my journey in software engineering and technology through this blog. Here, you'll find articles about my experiences, learnings, and insights from the tech world.

## Topics I'll Cover

- **Software Engineering Best Practices**: Lessons learned from real-world projects
- **Technology Deep Dives**: Exploring new technologies and frameworks
- **Career Development**: Insights from internships and professional growth
- **Personal Projects**: Behind-the-scenes of my side projects

## Why I'm Writing

Writing helps me consolidate my learning and share knowledge with the community. Through my experiences at companies like Shopify and Standard BioTools, I've learned valuable lessons that I believe can help others on their journey.

### What to Expect

1. **Technical Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for solving common problems
2. **Case Studies**: Real-world examples from my work experience
3. **Opinion Pieces**: My thoughts on industry trends and best practices
4. **Learning Resources**: Curated lists of helpful resources

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of the kind of content you'll find:

```javascript
// Example of a React hook for scroll animation
const useScrollAnimation = (threshold = 0.1) => {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      ([entry]) => setIsVisible(entry.isIntersecting),
      { threshold }
    );

    if (ref.current) observer.observe(ref.current);
    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, [threshold]);

  return [ref, isVisible];
};
```
